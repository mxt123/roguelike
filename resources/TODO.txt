TODO

sort out project relative paths

add Write 2d and tests to sort out funny bug in connected islands

rectangles not sorted

some points in islands/rooms are not counting as a point in the island not sure why (sharks can  spawn on these too ...)

change to use light  levels and fade rather than dark/light 

mobs should stay active once activated


islands algorithm failing on caves should do horizontals and verticals only not diagonals

splatmarks for dead mobs

import images from ipad

autoexplore + auto fight ?

dont random gen mobs on top (or even near player in world/caves)
caves arent properly creating with just one large room
mobs arent redrawing properly after killing one

add a noise map make noise activate and attract mobs 
if active look for noiseiest thing of map and try to move towards it
chance to become active if noise > wakeup threshold and not allready active
chance to deactivate if quiet and not active in last (mob thrshold turns)
scent trails

messages should have a colour (red for damage taken etc)

seperate light radius from aggro radius (eg infravision or tracking skills or stealth)

create things as light sources
set a light level for lights not just on/off

drill and join caves or trim any islands

add a list of precooked rooms as an enum and add these randomly in create dungeon
along with stairs/portals etc

island/and cave should provide the methods to populate the polygon with Tiles/things
new class of things for world objects

generate a new level of map between world and cave/dungeon start with zoomed out version of island
from world map 
	
that represent the poly

sort out mob and pc placement on cave maps
change connected island to give whole island back in results then we have 'rooms' to add stuff to
